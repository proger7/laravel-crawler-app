### Usage

Once configuration is complete you can then add the below at the meta area of the page you want to include meta tags;

```php
@include('meta::manager')
```

The above will use the predefined configurations to prefill the generated meta tags. However if you chose to define certain options on the fly then you can use the code below.


```php
@include('meta::manager', [
    'title'         => 'My Example Title',
    'description'   => 'This is my example description',
    'image'         => 'Url to the image',
])
```



### Example

```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <title>Document</title>
        @include('meta::manager', [
            'title'         => 'My Example Title',
            'description'   => 'This is my example description',
            'image'         => '',
